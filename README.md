# AI-Sat-Solving


### What is it about?

In this project we aim to explore a machineâ€™s ability to
reason on satisfiability problems using reinforcement
learning. We will be developing an environment that
feeds a random CNF formula with each training
episode, and the agent is tasked with simplifying the
formula efficiently to reach a correct solution. In the
following sections we will be giving a background to
our project before going into our planning and
execution.
